## Introduction

This document delineates the tokenomics of the two central tokens in our ecosystem: the liSUI, a liquid staking token, and the LSF, a governance token.

## 1. liSUI Token

### 1.1 Overview

The liSUI token is a liquid staking token with 9 decimals, akin to the original SUI token's structure. It is backed by staked SUI objects, signifying a stake in the underlying assets and facilitating participation in the DeFi ecosystem.

### 1.2 Token Details

- **Decimals**: 9
- **Backing Assets**: Staked SUI objects
- **Utility**: 
  - Representing a stake in the staked SUI assets
  - Facilitating participation in the DeFi ecosystem
  - Can be used in various financial products and services within the ecosystem

### 1.3 Value Proposition

- **Liquidity**: Provides liquidity to staked assets, allowing users to participate in the DeFi ecosystem without unstaking their assets.
- **Earning Staking Rewards**: The liSUI token appreciates in value as it earns staking rewards, with the price dictated by the contract, offering a mechanism to exchange SUI to liSUI and vice versa.
- **Integration with DeFi**: Enables seamless integration with various DeFi products and services, fostering a vibrant and dynamic ecosystem.

## 2. LSF Token

### 2.1 Overview

The LSF token is a governance token with a constant supply of 1 million units, functioning on a custom protocol and central to the decision-making process within the new DAO contract that is in the planning stages.

### 2.2 Token Details

- **Decimals**: 9
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000 LSF
- **Utility**: 
  - Central to the governance and decision-making processes within the DAO
  - Facilitates community engagement and participation in protocol development
  - Not intended for speculative trading or investment, and lacks store capability, preventing its use in DeFi platforms by design

### 2.3 Transferability

- **P2P Transactions**: LSF tokens can be transferred and traded peer-to-peer, but only from wallet to wallet, maintaining its utility focus and preventing speculative trading on DeFi platforms.

### 2.4 Distribution Plan

1. **Founders**: 35%
   - **Allocation**: 350,000 LSF
   - **Usage**: To be utilized at the discretion of the founding team for strategic planning and furthering the project's goals.

2. **Developers and Team**: 25%
   - **Allocation**: 250,000 LSF
   - **Distribution Method**: Repeating payments to incentivize ongoing development and commitment to the project. The exact schedule can be determined based on project milestones and individual contributions.

3. **Community and Ecosystem**: 30%
   - **Allocation**: 300,000 LSF
   - **Distribution Channels**:
     - **Community Rewards and Incentives**: 20% (60,000 LSF) - Distributed through community engagement initiatives, hackathons, and other events over a span of 2-3 years.
     - **Partnerships and Collaborations**: 10% (30,000 LSF) - Allocated for strategic partnerships and collaborations over a span of 2-3 years.

4. **Treasury**: 10%
   - **Allocation**: 100,000 LSF
   - **Usage**: Reserved for future developments, unforeseen contingencies, and to facilitate community proposals and initiatives. This fund acts as a safeguard to ensure the project's stability and sustainability.

#### Notes:

- **Governance Participation**: Encourage active participation from the community in governance decisions, including potential reallocation of treasury funds based on community proposals and votes.
- **Transparency**: Maintain transparency in the distribution process, with regular updates and reports to the community.
- **Adjustments**: The distribution plan should be flexible to allow for adjustments based on community feedback and changing ecosystem dynamics.

#### Conclusion

This distribution plan is designed to prioritize the motivation and responsibility of the founding team while also fostering a vibrant community and ecosystem. It ensures a significant stake for the founders, promoting a vested interest in the project's long-term success, while also allocating resources for community development and strategic growth.

### 2.5 Governance Mechanisms

- **Decision-Making**: Token holders will have a significant influence in the decision-making processes within the DAO, fostering a decentralized and community-driven governance structure.
- **Proposal Systems**: Systems will be developed where token holders can propose and discuss changes to the protocol, encouraging proactive community participation in governance.
- **Admin Capabilities Control**: The LSF token will be used in the DAO contract to control admin capabilities and manage treasury funds.
- **Protection Measures**: The DAO has the ability to freeze and remint LSF tokens to safeguard the ecosystem from malicious token holders.

### 2.6 Legal and Regulatory Compliance

- **Legal Framework**: A legal framework will be developed that clearly defines the token's utility and restricts its use for non-governance purposes, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Conclusion

The introduction of the liSUI and LSF tokens is a pivotal step towards constructing a robust and dynamic DAO. The liSUI token facilitates liquidity and integration with the DeFi ecosystem, while the LSF token nurtures a decentralized and community-driven governance structure. Together, they form the backbone of a vibrant and user-centric ecosystem.
